<b>Wiki</b>
The concept of Pictionary was first created by Robert Angel and his friends in 1981.
Angel and his roommates came up with the concept of the game, which proved
to be very popular between them. While originally hesitant to pitch the idea,
Angel was inspired by Trivial Pursuit, the gameplay of which was similar
to his concept and proved to him that such gameplay could work and be successful.

The team chooses one person to begin drawing; this position rotates with each word.
The drawer chooses a card out of a deck of special Pictionary cards and tries
to draw pictures which suggest the word printed on the card. The pictures
cannot contain any numbers or letters, nor can the drawers use spoken
clues about the subjects they are drawing. The teammates try to guess
the word the drawing is intended to represent.
